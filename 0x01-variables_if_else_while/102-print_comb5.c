/**
 * main - prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers
 *
 * Description: prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers:
 * - The numbers should range from 0 to 99
 * - The two numbers should be separated by a space
 * - All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
 * - The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
 * - The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
 * - 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination
 *   of the numbers 0 and 1
 * - You can only use the putchar function
 *   (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 * - You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
 * - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
 * - All your code should be in the main function
 * Return: 0 to signal good execution
